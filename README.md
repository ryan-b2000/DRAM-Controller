# DRAM-Controller

The DRAM Controller was a project I created for my graduate level advanced microprocessor class.
The project simulates a DRAM controller for a 4GB DDR4 DRAM. The project went through rigorous 
testing at the hands of my professor, Mark Faust, who fed the controller text files with a simulation
or DRAM requests from the cache controller.

Prior to demoing the project, I created test files that simulated as many conditions as possible and created
a python script that auto-generated test files with a user-specific number of entries.

I also created an excel spreadsheet that would encode/decode any 32-bit address into the DRAM specific row/column/bank
information.
